This program is to make it easier sharing data between S7 1200 PLC's. That is what I use it for anyway. The way Siemens does the sharing of data between PLCs is not flexible enough for me. Your milage may vary. The S7 1200 series has a limitation of connection count as well. I use an extra VM that runs this program 24/7. I control things using a request-feedback model. The program provides data retrieval, data synchronisation, a http json interface for troubleshooting and an online manual.
